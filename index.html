    <!-- Let’s start with the legal minimum requirements. These are the most basic elements that a privacy policy should have:

Who is the app owner?
What data is being collected? How is that data being collected?
What is the Legal basis for the collection? (e.g consent, necessary for your service, legal obligation etc.) – This is more specifically related to the GDPR and EU Law, however, even if you fall outside of GDPR obligations, it’s likely that under many other legislations, you’ll still need to say why you’re processing the personal data of users.
For which specific purposes are the data collected? Analytics? Email Marketing?
Which third parties will have access to the information? Will any third party collect data through widgets (e.g. social buttons) and integrations (e.g. Facebook Connect)?
What rights do users have? Can they request to see the data you have on them, can they request to rectify, erase or block their data? (under European regulations most of this is mandatory)
